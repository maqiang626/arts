To cloud or not to cloud? This question has been around for a while  now, as the cloud has opened the door to many opportunities for  companies. From not needing to maintain expensive servers to additional  development infrastructure, better deployment, and scale, moving to the  cloud has a lot to offer companies. However, the discussion for many  enterprises is perhaps no longer about the need for or the importance of adopting a cloud strategy but about moving toward adopting a  multi-cloud strategy.

## What is Multi-Cloud?

In a multi-cloud strategy, companies adopt more than one cloud  service provider to host their different applications. There are a  variety of reasons why businesses would want to do this, which we will  unpack throughout this blog.

However, before companies explore the possibilities of a multi-cloud strategy, they first need to determine if a [cloud strategy is for them](https://www.snapt.net/blog/12-benefits-and-challenges-of-multi-cloud-architectures) and understand what it will take to [architect their systems to become cloud-native](https://www.snapt.net/blog/8-steps-to-becoming-cloud-native). While you can just upload software to the cloud, it can be expensive if you don’t design it right, and adopting a multi-cloud strategy becomes  even more complicated.

## Finding the Cloud Provider for You

The first step in the cloud migration journey is to determine which  service provider to use. This step can become quite tricky, as you could be looking at any service provider, from Amazon to Google, Microsoft,  Oracle, and/or Digital Ocean, each with its own reliable and  cost-effective solution.

With so many options available and each cloud service provider  offering a different set of tools and pricing structures, it pays off  for companies to shop around and adopt services from the many different  cloud providers. This way, they will be able to build their products  with the right toolsets and get the best prices for their needs,  leveraging the offerings of the different providers.

## Our Reasons You Should Consider Adopting a Multi-Cloud Strategy

### 1.  Differing toolsets

No two cloud service providers are alike, and they each have their  own strengths and specialties in the different services they offer. When you are developing your applications, you may find that certain  features available on one cloud provider benefit one application,  whereas another application might be better suited to a feature on a  different cloud provider. Being in a position to utilize these different toolsets and features to your advantage could drastically improve the  effectiveness of your application.

Additionally, different departments within your organization will  likely have varied needs. Your application development team and IT  admins won’t use the same apps as those in the sales office. Having a  multi-cloud setup can address these needs and the fact that some  necessary applications can run better on one platform than on another.

### 2.  Reduced costs

Similar to the different toolsets, different cloud providers have  different costs, with some providers offering cheaper features. At the  same time, many fees might change depending on availability, and  sometimes, there are specials that can enable companies to switch cloud  providers for a period of time to take advantage of the better rates on  offer. Savings can drastically reduce costs, especially considering the  large amounts of money companies need to spend to use these cloud  services.

All this means is that a company that is best positioned to shift and move across to different cloud providers has the opportunity to save a  lot of money if it can design its applications correctly and make the  best use of its multi-cloud approach.

### 3.  Avoiding vendor lock-in

Designing your applications around one service provider locks you  into them. Should that day come where you decide to move to another  service provider, it will end up being a costly exercise with a  frustrated development team. And let’s face it: with things changing so  fast in the cloud space, you are going to be faced with moving across to a different system over time. Designing with multiple cloud providers  in mind might take longer to get started initially, but it gives you the freedom to move onto the platform that best suits you at any given  point in time while also easing that future maintenance burden.

A multi-cloud approach also provides the added flexibility to  transfer to a new provider whose pricing structures or capabilities are  more appealing than those offered by your current cloud provider. This  also allows you to optimize cloud usage costs across providers.

### 4.  Optimizing performance

The ability to pick and choose which services run on a particular  platform in a multi-cloud environment helps you create a level of  performance that’s specific to your organization’s needs. In a  single-cloud environment, you might not get optimal performance from  every application.

A multi-cloud strategy borrows from each incorporated platform’s  strengths, allowing your IT team to run workloads in the most  appropriate environment and seamlessly shift to another one if needed.

### 5.  Improving reliability

Reliability is all about staying online and available to your  clients, being highly performant, meeting the scale as needed,  and—importantly—security. Let’s use a distributed denial-of-service  attack (DDoS) as an example. If your cloud provider is hit with a DDoS  attack in a single-cloud model, there’s always a chance you could face  some costly downtime for at least some, if not all, applications.

Larger organizations with massive traffic often use backup clouds and maintain targeted load balancing across these clouds. They can split  traffic to optimize performance and mitigate widespread outages across  their network. Should one provider have an outage, these customers are  able to redirect traffic to another provider’s cloud infrastructure.

### 6.  Meet the world

Unless you’re a highly localized business offering a service to a  particular area, there is a chance that you will have potential clients  accessing your site from all around the world. While cloud providers try to have their services everywhere, it’s not feasible for them to be in  every place equally. Adopting a multi-cloud approach can allow you to  scale to where your customers need you the most, this is especially  important for entertainment, online retail, or gaming sites, which are  accessed from different parts of the globe all the time.

## Orchestrating Load Balancing and Scaling Needs

Having a multi-cloud setup solves all these challenges, but it  doesn’t come without its own complications. Orchestrating load, scaling, performance, and delivery and ensuring security across all the  different cloud providers can prove to be quite a headache for support  teams. This is especially relevant when there is no clear way to  visualize what is going on around the globe.

Having a [load orchestration tool like Nova ADC](https://www.snapt.net/solutions/multi-cloud-and-multi-location-application-delivery) pays off, as it allows you to deploy an open thin client across all your  different connected nodes, regardless of which cloud provider they  operate on. Even if you are hosting services in-house, Nova allows you  to have full control of your entire infrastructure from one central  point and gives you the big picture of exactly what is happening on your system across the globe.

All this information also allows [Nova ADC](https://www.snapt.net/platforms/nova-adc) to be able to make intelligent decisions on your behalf. With each node  speaking to each other, Nova can understand where your performance and  load needs are across your multi-cloud setup and ensure that your system meets those needs, responding to failures, load, and security threats  as they arise. This is all done proactively through its [AI system](https://www.snapt.net/platforms/nova-adc/cloud-controller), giving you the control you need to better manage your infrastructure when you need it the most.

Nova integrates with your locations and allows you to manage the  ADCs, configurations, Global Server Load Balancing (GSLB), and routing  to them through the central application. You can deploy ADCs into any  cloud (private or public) at the click of a button and view the stats  for all of your cloud platforms together. Nova reduces complexity and  cost by enabling seamless multi-cloud redundancy, autoscaling,  monitoring and optimization, and “least-cost routing,” all from a single dashboard.

Don’t let the complexity of multi-cloud stop you from achieving your  cloud dreams and leverage the tools available to make this orchestration easier and get the benefits without a few of the risks. Chat to the  Snapt team today about your cloud infrastructure needs.
