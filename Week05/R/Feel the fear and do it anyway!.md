It’s a strange feeling when you realise that even though you’ve  worked in a space for more than 4 years, you’ve been in a very small  bubble…but that’s what happened to me this year!

Back in 2017, I was Director of Platform Services EMEA at Pivotal when we announced [PKS (Pivotal Container Service) at VMworld](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OGihGeuljo), the forerunner to [VMware’s Kubernetes-based Tanzu platform](https://tanzu.vmware.com/tanzu). And although I spent a lot of time over the next few years talking to  customers about Kubernetes and helped drive our Kubernetes education  offerings, I did not personally participate in the broader Kubernetes  community.

That all changed this year after I left VMware and co-founded a new startup, [Syntasso](https://www.syntasso.io/). From my time at Pivotal, being a [Cloud Foundry Ambassador](https://www.cloudfoundry.org/community/), and participating in the Cloud Foundry community (under the umbrella of the Linux Foundation), I experienced first-hand the value and  importance of working with and contributing to a community, but was not  sure where to start with Kubernetes. Then in May 2021 I watched a [great panel discussion at KubeCon EU](https://youtu.be/6r0F5yfwf5s) by Kaslin Fields, Kohei Ota, Kat Cosgrove and Matt Broberg where they  discussed “Non-code Contribution In The Kubernetes Community”.

This gave me the encouragement I needed and I found my way to a [Github page](https://github.com/cncf/kubernetes-community-days) which talked about Kubernetes Community Days. Having been an organiser of [DevOpsDays London](https://devopsdays.org/events/2020-london/welcome/) for the last few years, I hoped that some of my past experience would  come in handy so I took the leap and contacted the organisers.

Reading through the list of organisers names for the UK event, I  didn’t know any of them personally and so I was uncertain of how my  offer of help would be received. But it turned out to be a risk worth  taking: they welcomed me with open arms, adding me to their organisers  Slack channel and inviting me to their next planning meeting. And 4  months later we ran the [Kubernetes Community Days UK 2021 event](https://community.cncf.io/events/details/cncf-kcd-uk-presents-kubernetes-community-days-uk-2021/): 27 speakers, 2 tracks of talks, 6 free technical workshops, 341 registered attendees, 1000+ YouTube views of content to date.

Now that the dust has settled on the event, I’m happy to share what I learned along the way and provide some recommendations as well as some  suggestions on things to avoid!

In terms of recommendations, the first thing to highlight is how  important it is to have a team of people to share the load. There is a  lot of work to do in running an event and I was very lucky to be part of an amazing group of co-organisers who really worked together to get  everything done. Some of the things that worked well included:

- **Speaker line-up:** we were keen to have speakers  representing different parts of the UK, as well having a diverse range  of voices, and the combination of our CfP as well as directly reaching  out to people in the community worked well
- **Code of conduct:** we set a mandatory field on sign-up for attendees to agree to follow the code of conduct (we used the [Linux Foundation CoC](https://events.linuxfoundation.org/code-of-conduct/)), we shared it with our speakers via email, and specifically reminded folks of it in the welcome remarks each day
- **Low barrier to entry:** we took the decision to make attendance to the talks and all of the  workshops free of charge and used sponsorship to cover the full costs
- **Supported local charities:** we selected two UK-based charities to donate our left-over proceeds to, and also offered each charity a speaking slot at the conference for  them to highlight the great work that they do
- **Great content delivered smoothly:** in order to provide a good experience for our speakers we gave them the option of either pre-recording or presenting live. For those that  presented live (the vast majority), we created individual calendar  invites with the Zoom call details included which worked great as all  speakers joined the right call at the right time!!

A few of the bumps we hit along the way included:

- **Logo**: our original logo included the union jack colours which led to some negative feedback, but thanks to our  co-organiser / designer [Josh Michielsen](https://mickey.dev), we were able to quickly change to a logo featuring the national flowers of the countries of the UK instead
- **Hybrid event:** our plan to make the event hybrid and run watch parties across the UK  didn’t work as well as we’d hoped and we only ended up with two watch  parties
- **Holidays**: running an event in September is tricky as lots of folks take holidays in August which meant getting  responses from people or having everyone around to keep things moving  was sometimes challenging
- **On the Day:** we left  planning on-the-day responsibilities to the end which meant some folks  were not available and there was a bit of juggling around of duties
- **Swag**: we had originally hoped to send swag to attendees in advance, but we  ended up confirming the details very late which meant folks will have a  while to wait before they receive it.

Overall, the event came together and we received fantastic feedback  from both speakers and attendees. I personally really enjoyed the whole  experience, particularly working with a wonderful group of kind and  welcoming co-organisers, as well as being able to bring together a great range of speaker content and workshops for free to the community.

My first experience of contributing to the Kubernetes community has  been lovely. I’ve met some great people, learned a lot, and I would  strongly recommend folks who are hesitant to take a leap of faith and  jump in wherever you can. I’d like to thank everyone involved and also  the CNCF for all of their guidance and support. Looking forward to KCD  UK 2022!
