Kubernetes is undoubtedly a champion in the container orchestration  world. But currently, we see that K3s or a lightweight Kubernetes  distribution which is light, efficient and fast with a drastically small footprint levelling up.

Businesses nowadays scratch their head what to use K3s or K8s in  their production. So, let’s discuss some of the many things that make  both K3s and K8s unique in their ways. And if you want to use one of  them in your business but want to prevent the struggle to choose one,  continue with me on this journey.

Let’s start!

## What is K3s?

K3s is a lightweight Kubernetes distribution that Rancher Labs, which is fully certified Kubernetes offering by CNCF. In K3s, we see that the memory footprint or binary which contains the components to run a  cluster is small. It means that K3s is small in size.

As K3s has a tiny binary, it is very lightweight, which makes the  installation process faster. Also, the deployment of applications with  this lightweight Kubernetes is faster. K3s has a built foundation on a  single binary which is less than 100 MB in size. As it is so tiny in  size, we can even run a K3s cluster in [Raspberry Pi](https://www.raspberrypi.org/) (small affordable computer hardware).

## Advantages of K3s

### Small Size

The best advantage of K3s is that it is minimal in size (less than  100 MB), which helps it launch a Kubernetes cluster in small hardware  with minimal settings.

### Fast Deployment

You can install and deploy k3s with one command under 30 seconds 🙃

```
curl -sfL https://get.k3s.io | sh -
# Check for Ready node,
takes maybe 30 seconds
k3s kubectl get node
```

### Lightweight

K3s, due to their small memory footprint, is very lightweight, which  helps the Kubernetes be up and running very quickly. It means that the  binary, which contains all the non-containerized components needed to  run a cluster, is smaller.

### Continuous Integration

K3s, because of their lightweight environment and small size, helps  in continuous integration. It helps in the automation of the integration of codes from multiple contributors into a single project.

### Perfect for IoT and Edge Computing

Because of support for ARM64 and ARMv7, K3s is very efficient for  Kubernetes distribution in production workloads for resource-constrained IoT devices.

### Simplified and Secure

A single binary file of less than 100 MB packages K3s, which makes it simple and also, the single binary file is easy to secure with fewer  complications.

## What is K8s?

[Kubernetes](https://www.p3r.one/kubernetes-from-google/) or K8s is the most popular orchestration tool for managing containers.  It is portable, flexible, and extensible and supports both imperative/  declarative configuration and automation with a large ecosystem as it’s a CNCF graduate project.

Kubernetes is designed to accommodate large configurations (up to 5000 nodes) and helps deploy applications in production.

## Advantages of K8s

### Portable

Kubernetes is highly portable because a variety of other  infrastructure and environment configuration uses Kubernetes. Most other orchestrators lack this portability because they are tied to particular runtime or infrastructure.

### Flexible

Kubernetes is very flexible because it can virtually work with any  container runtime (the program that runs containers). It is a part of  the Kubernetes cluster which relies on CRI-O to integrate Kubernetes  with CRI (Container Runtime Interface). But, this integration does not  work with all the container runtimes available, e.g. [runc](https://github.com/opencontainers/runc) or [Rkt](https://github.com/rkt/rkt). It uses kubelet to schedule containers.

### Multiple Cloud Capability

Kubernetes is vendor-agnostic, which means it can run on any  available infrastructure, including public, private, and hybrid clouds.

### Scalability

The ability to scale an application based on the quantity of incoming traffic is a cornerstone of any modern infrastructure. HPA (Horizontal  Pod Autoscaler) is an in-built resource in Kubernetes that determines  the required number of replicas for a service. Within Kubernetes,  elasticity is a highly automated core component.

### Open Source

Kubernetes is open-source and falls under the CNCF umbrella, and so  has better compatibility with other tools, which helps the whole project have community-driven contributors helping in quick bug fixing and  releases.

## k8s vs k3s: Difference

K3s are not functionally different from K8s, but they have some  differences that make them unique. K3s can deploy applications faster  than kubernetes. Not only that, K3s can spin up clusters more quickly  than K8s. K8s is a general-purpose container orchestrator, while K3s is a purpose-built container orchestrator for running Kubernetes on  bare-metal servers.

Kubernetes uses kubelet, an agent running on each Kubernetes node to  perform a control loop of the containers running on that node. This  agent runs inside the container. However, K3s does not use kubelet, but  it runs kubelet on the host machine and uses the host’s scheduling  mechanism to run containers.

Again, we can see that K3S is lightweight because of its small size, and this helps it run [clusters](https://www.vmware.com/topics/glossary/content/kubernetes-cluster#:~:text=A Kubernetes cluster is a,dependences and some necessary services.&text=Kubernetes clusters allow containers to,based%2C and on-premises.) in IoT devices such as [Raspberry Pi](https://www.raspberrypi.org/), which has limited resources. In contrast, we can see that normal  Kubernetes or K8s is not operable in IoT or edge computing devices.  Also, K3s supports both ARM64 and ARMv7 with binaries.

Kubernetes or K8s can host [workloads](https://www.delltechnologies.com/en-in/learn/cloud/cloud-workloads.htm#:~:text=A cloud workload is a,are all considered cloud workloads.) running across multiple environments, while K3s can only host workloads running in a single cloud. It mainly happens because K3s don’t contain  the capacity to maintain a significant workload on multiple clouds as it is small in size. 

At the same time, we can see that Kubernetes, due to its heavy size,  takes advantage of hosting workloads and spin up clusters in multiple  clouds. K3s is a standalone server, unlike K8s, which is a part of the  Kubernetes cluster. K8s relies on CRI-O to integrate Kubernetes with CRI (Container Runtime Interface) while K3s uses CRI-O, and therefore is  compatible with all of the supported container runtimes. K8s uses  kubelet to schedule containers, but K3s uses the host’s scheduling  mechanism to schedule containers.

K3s uses [kube-proxy](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/components/#:~:text=kube-proxy is a network,or outside of your cluster.) to proxy the network connections of the Kubernetes nodes, but K8s uses  kube-proxy to proxy the network connections of an individual container.  It also uses kube-proxy to set up IP masquerading, while K3s does not  use kube-proxy to do that.

 Again, K8s uses [kubelet](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/command-line-tools-reference/kubelet/#:~:text=The kubelet is the primary,object that describes a pod.) to watch the Kubernetes nodes for changes in the configuration, while  K3s does not watch Kubernetes nodes for changes in the configuration.  Instead, it receives a deployment manifest containing the configuration  information from the Kubernetes control plane and makes changes  accordingly.

Kubernetes can be very beneficial when it comes to [orchestration](https://www.redhat.com/en/topics/containers/what-is-container-orchestration) (arrangement and coordination of automated tasks) of large databases as it can maintain the load of the database. At the same time, k3s can be  more than useful for small databases. It happens to come in a single  binary file of less than 100 MB, which will help to fire up quick  clusters, faster scheduling pods and other tasks.

k3s can have [tighter security](https://sysdig.com/blog/k3s-sysdig-falco/) deployment than k8s because of their small attack surface area. Another advantage of k3s is that it can reduce the dependencies and steps  needed to install, run or update a Kubernetes cluster.

## Should I choose k3s or k8s?

From the above discussion, it is visible that both K3s and K8s have  their pros and cons, which make them unique and different from each  other. Both are very useful, but given a business situation, the usage  of a particular can impact.

We have seen how K8s can be beneficial for large applications, and  keeping that in mind, a big market cap business that deals with a large  amount of data and has its workload distribution in several cloud  servers can use K8s, which will help them in a lot of ways.

Medium cap businesses can decide to use both K3s and K8s because they will not have an actual size of the application throughout. It will  help them use K8s to deal with the large [workloads](https://www.delltechnologies.com/en-in/learn/cloud/cloud-workloads.htm#:~:text=A cloud workload is a,are all considered cloud workloads.), while for a quick spin-up of a cluster in small production, K3s can be  beneficial. Maintaining the balance between K3s and K8s can help the  business save a lot of money while keeping the regular work going.

Small-cap businesses which don’t have any work with the large  application can automatically prefer K3s because K3s is very quick while deploying applications with small workloads, and also installation,  running, and updates are easy.

Independent developers keen on IoT, and edge computing has a  significant advantage while choosing K3s as their Kubernetes  distributor. They will be working with many low resources containing  computational hardware like Raspberry Pi and others. We all know how K3s comes in a small single binary file and runs on IoT devices due to  ARM64 and ARMv7 support.

## **Final Thoughts**

You might think k3s is better than “full-fat” Kubernetes but let me  remind you for k3s limitations exist. Currently, k3s doesn’t support  running more than a master and any other database apart from SQLite on  the master node. So, defining needs and goals is quite important when  you choose your default container orchestrator.

I hope you are clear about Kubernetes and k3s to a considerable  extent after this post. If you want to learn and explore, the official  tutorial would be an excellent place to start. Feel free to dive down  into similar posts:
